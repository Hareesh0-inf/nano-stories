# [PROJECT_NAME] Constitution
<!-- Example: Spec Constitution, TaskFlow Constitution, etc. -->

## Core Principles

### [PRINCIPLE_1_NAME]
I. Library-First
[PRINCIPLE_1_DESCRIPTION]
Every feature starts as a standalone library; Libraries must be self-contained, independently testable, documented; Clear purpose required - no organizational-only libraries

### [PRINCIPLE_2_NAME]
II. No overcomplexity
[PRINCIPLE_2_DESCRIPTION]
Every function and every module should be simple and more readable with documentations. Do not overcomplicate things and functionality

### [PRINCIPLE_3_NAME]
III. Test-First (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
[PRINCIPLE_3_DESCRIPTION]
TDD mandatory: Tests written → User approved → Tests fail → Then implement; Red-Green-Refactor cycle strictly enforced

### [PRINCIPLE_4_NAME]
IV. Integration Testing
[PRINCIPLE_4_DESCRIPTION]
Focus areas requiring integration tests: New library contract tests, Contract changes, Inter-service communication, Shared schemas

### [PRINCIPLE_5_NAME]
V. Functionality first UI second
[PRINCIPLE_5_DESCRIPTION]
Do not spend more resources on UI make it simple and neat with as less components as possible

## [SECTION_2_NAME]
Build for everyone - follow open source guidelines

<!-- Example: Technology stack requirements, compliance standards, deployment policies, etc. -->

## [SECTION_3_NAME]
<!-- Example: Development Workflow, Review Process, Quality Gates, etc. -->

[SECTION_3_CONTENT]
<!-- Example: Code review requirements, testing gates, deployment approval process, etc. -->

## Governance
<!-- Example: Constitution supersedes all other practices; Amendments require documentation, approval, migration plan -->

[GOVERNANCE_RULES]
<!-- Example: All PRs/reviews must verify compliance; Complexity must be justified; Use [GUIDANCE_FILE] for runtime development guidance -->
