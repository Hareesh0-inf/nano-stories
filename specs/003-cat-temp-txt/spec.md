# Feature Specification: Build a Web Application for Brand Storytelling

**Feature Branch**: `003-cat-temp-txt`  
**Created**: September 7, 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "build a web application that will help businesses in brand storytelling. It will make the process quick and easy. It will have four layers as mentioned in the readme. The user will first create a project, then we prompt to ask character details. We generate the character, get approval from user then ask for their product image, then ask the user for scene details and generate a background, get approval from user then finally ask what story they want to show in the image, aggregate all the prompts make 3 versions of the same prompt by adding little creativity to and generate three images for the user to select from. It doesn't need to have authentications. It must be an open source"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a business user, I want to create a brand storytelling project, provide character details to generate a character, approve it, provide product image, provide scene details to generate background, approve it, provide story details to generate three creative images for selection.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the user starts a new project, **When** they provide character details, **Then** the character is generated and approval is requested.
2. **Given** the character is approved, **When** they provide product image, **Then** the product is integrated.
3. **Given** the product is provided, **When** they provide scene details, **Then** the background is generated and approval is requested.
4. **Given** the background is approved, **When** they provide story details, **Then** three versions of the prompt are created and three images are generated for selection.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the user does not approve the generated character?
- What happens when the product image is not provided or invalid?
- What happens when the scene details are incomplete?
- What happens when the story details are not provided?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST allow users to create a new project.
- **FR-002**: System MUST prompt for character details.
- **FR-003**: System MUST generate character based on provided details.
- **FR-004**: System MUST request user approval for the generated character.
- **FR-005**: System MUST prompt for product image.
- **FR-006**: System MUST integrate the product image.
- **FR-007**: System MUST prompt for scene details.
- **FR-008**: System MUST generate background based on scene details.
- **FR-009**: System MUST request user approval for the generated background.
- **FR-010**: System MUST prompt for story details.
- **FR-011**: System MUST aggregate all provided prompts.
- **FR-012**: System MUST create 3 versions of the aggregated prompt by adding little creativity and fusing character, product, background and story.
- **FR-013**: System MUST generate three images based on the three prompts.
- **FR-014**: System MUST allow the user to select from the three generated images.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Project**: Represents a brand storytelling project, contains character, product, background, story details.
- **Character**: Generated based on user details, includes personality and appearance.
- **Product**: Image provided by user, integrated into the final images.
- **Background**: Generated based on scene details, includes lighting.
- **Story**: Details provided by user for the narrative.
