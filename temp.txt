build a web application that will help businesses in brand storytelling. It will make the process quick and easy. It will have four layers as mentioned in the readme. The user will first create a project, then we prompt to ask character details. We generate the character, get approval from user then ask for their product image, then ask the user for scene details and generate a background, get approval from user then finally ask what story they want to show in the image, aggregate all the prompts make 3 versions of the same prompt by adding little creativity to and generate three images for the user to select from. It doesn't need to have authentications. It must be an open source
